description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Heimdall is the guardian of the Bifrost Bridge, and as its gatekeeper, he controls access and travel between Asgard and the other nine realms. With his all-seeing eyes, Heimdall protects Asgard and all of its citizens. He is the first line of defense against any intrusion or invasion. Heimdall is also the brother of Sif, the goddess of war, and the son of Nine Mothers, who are sisters that were all impregnated by Odin, the All-Father. Heimdall is the only one who can open the Bifrost Bridge to allow Thor and his friends to travel to Jotunheim, the land of the Frost Giants. Heimdall is also the only one who can open the Bifrost Bridge to allow Thor and his friends to travel to Jotunheim, the land of the Frost Giants. Heimdall is also the only one who can open the Bifrost Bridge to allow Thor and his friends to travel to Jotunheim, the land of the Frost Giants.
